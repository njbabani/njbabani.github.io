## About Me
---
I'm a 4th-Year MEng student studying Electronic and Electrical Engineering at University College London. I have had the pleasure of encountering fascinating engineering problems throughout my undergraduate course and I look forward to applying my knowledge in other areas of applied mathematics. I am currently interested in the field of mobile robotics with machine learning for search-and-rescue applications. A quote regarding Fermat's Last Theorem encapsulates my philosophy on problem solving:

> "Of course, to a mathematician, all this is irrelevant. It's a beautiful problem, and its solution led to many beautiful ideas. That is its complete justification."
